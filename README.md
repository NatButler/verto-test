# Verto test: iOTA

## Setup / requirements
As Git / GitHub seems to ignore empty directories, once cloned, please create a directory named `uploads` under the `assets` folder within the `wwwroot` directory. This is required to run the project as the controllers/views depend on it.

Included in the `IOTA` directory of the repo is a `IOTA.BAK` file, as requested, containing the DB data.
